Some problems I solved as I learnt functional programming. This includes some questions from Advent of Code and other problems I found online. At first, coding in Racket was a huge, unintuitive change from the regular object oriented programming I was used to. But now I understand the benefits and beauty of functional programming. 

The problems solved in this Racket file include math problems, basic binary search tree functions, functions that work with words,
strings, association lists, structures, trees, implicit and explicit recursion and more.

functional.rkt follows the standard Racket template which includes - structure documentation, brief function documentation, function body and test pairs
